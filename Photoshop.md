It seems like you are interested in Photoshop actions. Photoshop actions are a series of recorded commands that you can apply to a single file or a batch of files. They can save you a lot of time if you need to perform repetitive tasks.

Here is a basic guide on how to create and use Photoshop actions:

### Creating a Photoshop Action

1. **Open Photoshop** and load an image you want to work with.
2. **Open the Actions Panel** by going to `Window > Actions`.
3. **Create a New Action**:
   - Click the `Create new action` button (a square icon with a plus sign) at the bottom of the Actions panel.
   - Name your action and click `Record`.
4. **Perform the Steps** you want to record. For example, you might want to apply a filter, adjust the color balance, and resize the image.
5. **Stop Recording**:
   - Once you have completed all the steps, click the `Stop` button (a square icon) at the bottom of the Actions panel.

### Applying a Photoshop Action
